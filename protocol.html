<h1 class="title">Segmentation review protocol</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>You will be reviewing fish images and rating the segmentation as
successful (thumbs up) or unsuccessful (thumbs down) on Amazon
Mechanical Turk. Our research goal is to identify fish color patterns.
Thank you for your assistance with this project!</p>
<p>Unsuccessful segmentations come in the following forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to remove a <strong>significant</strong> portion of
background</li>
<li>Removal of a <strong>significant</strong> portion of the actual
fish</li>
<li><strong>Significantly</strong> rough or unclean edges around the
segmented fish image</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Significance is determined at the discretion of the reviewer as to
whether the loss of data or extra pixels would affect the identification
of fish patterns. If unsure, it is best to opt for an unsuccessful
rating.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For a quantitative estimate, if 10% or more of the image is extra or
lost pixels, it is likely an unsuccessful segmentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="successful-segmentations">Successful segmentations</h2>
<p><img src="1.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean edges around the fish</li>
<li>No background information</li>
<li>The whole fish is preserved</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="2.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>No background information</li>
<li>Although the image is low quality, the shape of the fish is
preserved with no loss of major fish parts</li>
<li>Images can have rough edges and low quality! As long as the rough
edges do not lead to a significant cumulative loss of image data!</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="3.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, the angle of the fish is not a problem</li>
<li>The fish has clean edges, with no background information</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="4.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Although, there is some loss in the fish’s tail, the majority of the
tail is still visible</li>
<li>The rest of the fish is well-segmented</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="5.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Some background information got through, but in total it does not
account for 10% or more of the final image</li>
<li>There wasn’t significant loss of fish data</li>
<li>Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell if the amount of background
is significant or not</li>
<li><strong>If you are unsure, please rate the image as unsuccessfully
segmented</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="6.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>This fish is an interesting case</li>
<li>There is some slight background that got through near the bottom,
but that is a minimal gain in pixels and insignificant</li>
<li>The back of the fish is quite blurry and low quality, but we are not
assessing quality but rather the visibility of patterns</li>
<li>Some rough edges on the lower half of the fish, but they do not
introduce excess background information or cause a large loss of
data</li>
<li>Therefore, this is a <strong>successful segmentation</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unsuccessful-segmentations">Unsuccessful segmentations</h2>
<p><img src="7.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>There is clearly a huge loss of information in this image,
specifically, the back half of the fish</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="8.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>At first look, this fish looks fairly well-segmented: clean edges,
patterns are clear…</li>
<li>However, the fish appears to have lost its tail</li>
<li>Small losses that consist of a whole fish part result in
<strong>unsuccessful segmentation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="9.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>A large portion of the segmented image consists of extraneous
background image</li>
<li>The background would likely affect our ability to identify fish
patterns</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="10.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The segmenter cut out the fish image, not the background</li>
<li>There is a clear loss of fish data and a presence of significant
background</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="11.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The loss of both the tail and a whole fin means this is an
<strong>unsuccessful segmentation</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In summary, unsuccessfully segmented images are defined as follows: *
Failure to remove a significant portion of extraneous information or
background * Removal of a significant portion of the actual fish of
focus * Significantly rough or unclean edges around the segmented fish
image</p>
<p>In cases where it is difficult to give a rating, please rate the
image as an unsuccessful segmentation. Thank you for your help!</p>
